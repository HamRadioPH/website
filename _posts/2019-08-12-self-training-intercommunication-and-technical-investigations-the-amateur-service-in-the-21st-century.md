The amateur service is one of the oldest radio services, predating regulation. Recalling his earliest experiments, Marconi proudly referred to himself as an amateur. Today more than three million radio amateurs throughout the world follow in his footsteps and those of other radio pioneers, motivated by curiosity, and the desire to understand and harness the natural phenomena that influence radiowave propagation.

In so doing, they expand the body of human knowledge and technical skills that are essential to development, and offer a resource that can literally save lives when natural disasters disrupt normal communications channels, all at very low cost.
